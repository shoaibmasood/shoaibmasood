# Hi there, I'm Shoaib Masood! üëã

I'm a passionate Software Engineer focusing on delivering intuitive and impactful user experiences through cutting-edge technologies. My main areas of expertise include Frontend development, Web3, and Blockchain, but I'm always eager to explore and learn new technologies to build innovative solutions. I'm currently based in the United Kingdom. Previously, I worked at CareCloud Inc, where I collaborated with amazing people to solve challenging problems. I completed my Master's in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Hertfordshire in the UK. During my Master's thesis project, I researched and developed a fully decentralized Blockchain-based voting Fullstack app using Next.js and Solidity.

## üöÄ Current Projects

- **[React SPA: Responsive Grid with Configurable Rows and Columns](https://github.com/shoaibmasood/React-SPA-Responsive-Grid-with-Configurable-Rows-and-Columns/)**: A responsive single-page application built with React, TypeScript, and Context API. This project features a dynamic grid of viewports controlled by a collapsible sidebar. Users can define the number of rows and columns (1-10), and the grid adjusts to fill the available space evenly, adapting to browser resizes. Each viewport displays its size at the center. The UI focuses on a clean, modern user experience, with thorough unit testing implemented using the React Testing Library.
- **[Decentralized Voting App](https://github.com/shoaibmasood/decentralized-voting-app)**: This project is a fully decentralized voting system aimed at enhancing the transparency and security of the voting process. Built with Next.js, Solidity, and Web3.js, it uses blockchain technology to create a secure and tamper-proof voting platform. Key features include voter authentication, encrypted vote storage, and real-time vote tallying.
- **[Portfolio Project](https://github.com/shoaibmasood/portfolioProject)**: A visually appealing and responsive portfolio to showcase my skills and past work experience, built with React and TailwindCSS.
- **[Devcamper API](https://github.com/shoaibmasood/Devcamper-API)**: A fully functional backend API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, featuring advanced features like filtering, pagination, and JWT authentication.

## üå± What I'm Currently Up To

- Learning more about **Web3 development** and diving deep into **smart contract security**.
- Exploring **Generative AI** and understanding its applications and potential in various domains.
